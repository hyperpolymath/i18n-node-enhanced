# Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

## Project Status

**i18n-node-enhanced** operates under the **Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)**.

**Current Perimeter:** **3 (Community Sandbox)**

---

## What is TPCF?

The Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework is a graduated trust model for open source contributions that balances:
- **Security** - Protection of critical infrastructure
- **Openness** - Welcoming community participation
- **Scalability** - Sustainable governance as projects grow

### Three Perimeters

### Comparison to Traditional Models

| Model | Entry Barrier | Security | Scalability |
|-------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **Benevolent Dictator** | High | High | Low |
| **Commit Bit** | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **TPCF** | None (P3) | High (P1) | High |
| **Fully Open** | None | Low | High |

TPCF provides **both** openness (Perimeter 3) and security (Perimeter 1).

## FAQ

### Q: Why not just use branch protection?
**A:** Branch protection is binary (commit or not). TPCF provides graduated access with clear progression.

### Q: How is this different from GitHub's permission system?
**A:** GitHub has Read/Triage/Write/Maintain/Admin. TPCF adds workflow and trust model on top.

### Q: Can I contribute without joining Perimeter 2/1?
**A:** Absolutely! Most contributions happen at Perimeter 3. Progression is optional.

### Q: How long does PR review take at Perimeter 3?
**A:** Target: 7 days. Reality: 1-14 days depending on complexity and maintainer availability.

### Q: What if I disagree with a perimeter decision?
**A:** Discuss in GitHub Discussions. Decisions can be appealed. Process is documented.

### Q: Does TPCF apply to documentation?
**A:** Yes, but documentation PRs often merge faster (lower security risk).

### Q: Can companies sponsor perimeter access?
**A:** No. Access is merit-based only. Companies can sponsor development time, not access.

## Emotional Safety

TPCF supports emotional safety by:

- **Reversibility:** Experimental contributions can be reverted without stigma
- **Clarity:** Clear expectations reduce anxiety
- **Recognition:** Graduated trust acknowledges contributions
- **Autonomy:** Contributors choose their level of engagement
- **Safety:** Perimeter 1 protects critical infrastructure from stress/burnout

See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for full emotional safety commitments.
